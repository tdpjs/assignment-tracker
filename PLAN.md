# Project's Plan

1. How will you Coordinate your work?

David will coordinate the work by managing the project’s process. He will do this by setting clear goals, communicating regularly to keep the team aligned, assigning responsibilities to team members, creating a timeline, and monitoring progress to ensure we stay on track. He will also provide feedback as needed to ensure everyone is producing quality work. These tasks will be addressed during meetings held twice a week, allowing us to address any issues in the process.

2. What tools will you use to communicate?

We will primarily use Discord as our main communication method for contacting all team members. Discord also allows us to hold virtual meetings if a team member cannot attend in person due to illness or injury. For written documents, we are currently using Google Docs, as it’s flexible and convenient for everyone. However, we are also considering Notion since most team members use it in their personal or academic life, making it a potentially better alternative for a more organized process.

For virtual meetings, we could use Zoom as an alternative, but we prefer Discord since all team members are already familiar with it, which means there’s little to no learning curve.

3. Who will own the component in your architecture?

   Hankyul will be responsible for the project's architecture because, as a team, we believe he is methodical and careful in his coding. He also has a keen eye for errors and a high level of attention to detail

5. How will you verify that you’ve met your requirements?

There are some requirements that do not need explicit tests. For example, we do not need to write tests to verify if the box is centered or if the text on the buttons is aligned. However, there is still a lot to test in our app. We need to check various types of inputs, such as user clicks with the mouse or text input in boxes for the class name, course, date, time, and website links.

When inspecting the code, I will ask the developer questions and split the code into smaller, digestible sections to better understand its functionality. If any uncertainties arise, I will suggest testing approaches that could potentially reveal issues or clarify the code’s behavior. When verifying requirements, I will look at the specific code segments relevant to each one. For instance, if a requirement states, "The user is able to click an add button," I would locate the part of the code handling the button input from a user’s cursor.

To confirm functionality, we will examine the display after each code block that represents a feature, ensuring that all text is aligned, boxes are centered, links work, and buttons are interactive. Depending on the code segment, we may or may not use automated tests, as some parts do not require them.

During the testing phase, we will commit and test after each implementation, approximately every 30 minutes or at the end of each coding session, as a precaution to prevent extensive rework. Each testing session will involve at least two to three people, including Hankyul (Designer), to ensure we have multiple perspectives when checking for errors or correct implementation.

## Known bugs
1. ### Overdue assignments not filtered properly
    - When `Show Overdue` is unchecked, assignments due on the same day with a later time DO NOT get displayed when they should.
 
2. ### Text is glitchy on mobile
    - As mentioned above. However, this is reported by *user 1*. All group members do not encounter this problem. 

3. ### Email notifications 
    - Supposedly, we will email all users their incoming assignments in the next week on Sunday 20:00 before the week starts.
    - David:
    - This is feature is working on a limited scale. "Limited scale" refers to limited number of emails can be sent within a limited time range.
    - We can unlock more features by subscribing to Firebase. The group has decided NOT to proceed more with this feature because we all agreed that subscribing is not worth it.

4. ### Description of buttons
    - Usually, when you hover over a button, there will be a short description of what that button does. For example, the `like button` on YouTube. If you have not liked the video, and you hover over the `like` button by a cursor, a small rectangular box with text `like` will pop up after you hover the button for a brief second. That is what we want to achieve.
    - We put this under `BUGS.md` because we did not have enough time to implement this feature, but this feature is a small details that would make the app more comprehensive.

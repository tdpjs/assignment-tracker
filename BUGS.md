# Known bugs
1. ### Overdue assignments not filtered properly
    - When `Show Overdue` is unchecked, assignments due on the same day with a later time DO NOT get displayed when they should.
 
2. ### Text is glitchy on mobile
    - As mentioned above. However, this is reported by *user 1*. All group members do not encounter this problem. 

3. ### Email notifications 
    - Supposedly, we will email all users their incoming assignments in the next week on Sunday 20:00 before the week starts.
    - David:
    - This is feature is working on a limited scale. "Limited scale" refers to limited number of emails can be sent within a limited time range.
    - We can unlock more features by subscribing to Firebase. The group has decided NOT to proceed more with this feature because we all agreed that subscribing is not worth it.

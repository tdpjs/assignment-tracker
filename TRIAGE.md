## Priorities of issues to be resolved:

### 1. "Edit" button not functional
**Justification**: being able to edit an assignment after it has been added is one of the core functionalities of the app. It not being functional is unacceptable and thus it will be the first issue to be resolved.

### 2. "Show Overdue" feature not working as expected
**Justification**: The feature was filtering out all assignments that were due on the same day the user was using the app, regardless of the due time. This is not intuitive because an assignment may be due later in the day and should be shown when queried at an earlier due time.
This could prove detrimental to users as they may miss assignments that are not yet due. As such it shall be the next prioritized issue to be resolved


### 3. Filters not matching all cases
**Justification**: Prior to the issue being discovered, the filter feature was case-sensitive. Although this isn't entirely dysfunctional, it did not make for a very good user experience. As such, we shall make it case-insensitive after the more important issues are resolved. 

### 4. Non-valid links in submission and resources cells displayed as valid links
**Justification**: This is lower on the list because it doesn't affect the core functionalities of the app. It is a small UI issue. However it is quite simple to resolve so it will be worked on after the other issues have been resolved.

### 5. The UI is not responsive to different screen sizes

**Justification**: Making the UI responsive to different screen sizes is a task that is tedious and takes significant time. Given that we do not have the time, this issue will not be fixed and thus is lowest on the priority list.
